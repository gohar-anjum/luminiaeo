ROLE & OBJECTIVE
You are a Principal Front-End Architect & UX Director. Build a production-level front-end for LUMINI AEO (Answer Engine Optimization Platform for Generative AI), from scratch. The result must look like a commercial SaaS (think Ahrefs / Semrush / AnswerThePublic), be highly organized, and follow HCI principles.

Tech: Prefer React + TypeScript with Vite and TailwindCSS. You may also use shadcn/ui (Radix UI) for quality components, Lucide for icons, Recharts for simple charts, and D3 for the clustering tree. No backend—use dummy data and mock APIs.

Deliver a clean, responsive, accessible, professional app that a faculty panel would consider presentation-ready.

1) Visual Identity & Design System (Professional)

Brand: LUMINI AEO

Avoid emojis. Use icons only (Lucide).

Color Palette (professional & modern):

3) Interaction & UX Rules (HCI)

No emojis. Clean icons only.

Always show system status: skeleton loaders, progress bars, toasts.

Clear empty states with helpful copy.

Tables: sticky header, zebra rows, column sort, search filter.

Forms: label + helper text + validation + disabled submit until valid.

Charts: only where they communicate better than tables; never full-width unless needed.

Keyboard navigation, focus rings, ARIA attributes, proper color contrast (WCAG AA).

Responsive breakpoints:

≥1440px desktop: comfortable spacing, 4-column card grid

≥1024px laptop: 3 columns

≥768px tablet: 2 columns, collapsed sidebar

<768px mobile: single column, off-canvas sidebar

4) Implementation Details & Libraries

Scaffold: Vite + React + TypeScript

Styling: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)

Icons: Lucide

Charts: Recharts (simple), D3 (tree)

State: Local state only; mock fetch with setTimeout

Dummy Data: /src/data/* JSONs for each module

No backend—but structure code so APIs can be plugged later.

Folder Structure

  /utils            (formatters, mockFetch, validations)

Key Components

Sidebar.tsx (grouped sections, nested items, collapse, active states)

NavBar.tsx (search, notifications, user menu, dark mode toggle)

Card.tsx, StatCard.tsx, ChartCard.tsx

DataTable.tsx (sortable, searchable)

TreeView.tsx (D3 hierarchical tree)

Toast.tsx, Modal.tsx

FormInput.tsx, Select.tsx, TextArea.tsx

SnippetPreview.tsx (Meta preview)

5) Acceptance Criteria (DoD)

Visual polish: Comparable to Ahrefs/Semrush—organized, clean, premium.

Sidebar: Full, grouped, professional; collapsible; proper icons; no emojis.

Home/About/Contact: Look like real marketing pages, not placeholders.

Dashboard: 4 compact cards + recent activity + pinned; no oversized charts.

Each Module Page: Has correct inputs, tables, and minimal necessary charts.

Clustering: Working D3 tree with expand/collapse; table view + export.

PBN Detector: Risk chips and disavow export (dummy).

Meta Optimizer: Validations and live snippet preview.

HCI & A11y: Visible states, ARIA, keyboard access, contrast checked.

Responsive: Clean on desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile.

Code Quality: Typed components, modular structure, comments where needed.

6) Data & Mocking

Provide realistic dummy JSON for each module (10–50 rows).

Create mockFetch(resource) that returns the JSON with a 600–900ms delay for realism.

Use localStorage to simulate auth (logged-in session).

7) What to Output

A fully runnable project with the structure above.

Complete pages, components, styles, and data files.

Clear README with:

npm i

npm run dev

Notes on where to plug real APIs later.
